# SBSPS-Challenge-4624-Sentiment-Analysis-of-COVID-19-tweets---Visualization-Dashboard
Project using machine learning algorithms and python to analyse the sentiment of a person using the subjectivity and polarity score.
## Analysis Methods

### Sentiment Analysis

**TextBlob Polarity & Subjectivity Score**: We utilized [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html), a popular NLP library, to conduct sentiment analysis by generating polarity score (negative \[-1 ~ +1] positive) and subjectivity score (objective \[0 ~ 1] subjective). 
Examples: 
- 'Great!' Polarity = 1
- 'This is the worst situation.' Polarity = -1
- 'It's raining.' Subjectivity = 0
- 'I love the rain!' Subjectivity = 1
